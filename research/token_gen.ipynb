Mobile iPhone and iPad The best iPhone 15 alternatives: 6 phones to consider before you buy The iPhone 15 looks great, but it's not for everyone. By Andrew Grush • January 17, 2024 Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority Apple recently unveiled its latest flagship series, the iPhone 15 family. The latest iPhones bring quite a few features and a welcome move to USB-C. There’s a lot to love about them, but what if you aren’t sold on iOS or want something different? That’s what we are here for. Join us as we take a look at the best iPhone 15 alternatives on the market today. Apple iPhone 14 series Robert Triggs / Android Authority If you’re looking for the best alternative to the iPhone 15 series, you might just want to stick with the iPhone 14 family . Sure, you’ll be dealing with slightly older hardware, but you’ll also save a good amount of cash. You’ll also get the same software eventually now that the iOS 17 update has rolled out. The iPhone 14 family varies a bit depending on what model you get. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have the most in common, as both use the same Apple A16 Bionic SoC and storage variants ranging from 128GB to 512GB. There are also the same 12MP wide and ultrawide cameras. Battery life is better on the Plus thanks to its larger size, and of course, the Plus has a larger 6.7-inch screen compared to the iPhone 14. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max jump up to an Apple A16 processor and have storage configurations as high as 1TB. They also have the same 48MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 12MP telephoto lenses. Even if they are a year old, the iPhone 14 series holds up extremely well against the iPhone 15 and 2023 Android flagships. Just be aware you won’t get Apple’s Apple A17 on the Pro series or the A16 on the iPhone 14 and Plus. You’ll also be stuck with a Lightning port over USB-C . Apple iPhone 14 Apple iPhone 14 All-day battery life  •  Capable cameras  •  Great software support MSRP: $799.00 The cheapest phone of the series While the iPhone 14 isn't a massive upgrade over its predecessor, it's still a great phone overall. It has a great design, long-term software support, and a capable camera system. It also costs a lot less than the other phones in the series.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 series fits the bill, with a comprehensive list of hardware and software features. The three models in the range share base specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, 120Hz AMOLED displays, an IP68 rating, and similar tertiary cameras. As with the iPhone 15 series, the models have a few differences. The Galaxy S24 is the smallest option, with a 6.2-inch display and a 4,000mAh battery. Just above it on the pecking order is the Galaxy S24 Plus, packing a larger 6.7-inch display and a 4,900mAh battery. For those who crave everything and the kitchen sink, the Galaxy S24 Ultra brings a titanium frame, an S Pen , a 200MP primary camera, two telephoto lenses with optically reach up to 5x, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The biggest selling point for most will be Samsung’s new software commitments. All three devices will receive updates for seven years, extending their working lives well into the 2030s. Samsung is also pushing its AI smarts with tools that enrich the phones’ productivity and imaging powers. While the two base models retain their predecessors’ sticker prices, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a little pricier this year. Samsung Galaxy S24 Samsung Galaxy S24 Slimmer than ever  •  Victus 2 glass  •  Bright display MSRP: $799.99 Powerful AI smarts and slimmer bezels The Samsung Galaxy S24 series focuses on added AI technology. With a 6.2-inch, 120Hz display, 128GB or 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and up to 2,600 nits peak display brightness, the S24 is promising to be a quality update in the line. The new AI features go deep, improving your experience with the camera, search, and much more.

While its specs might not be quite as powerful as some of the others on this list, it has one of the best smartphone camera experiences you’ll find. It’s also a bit more affordable, which is a nice bonus. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are both powered by the same Tensor G3 chipset, which adds plenty of machine learning and AI capabilities that help it shine. It’s also much better at heat dissipation, something that was a serious issue for the Pixel 7 family. The Pixel 8 is the smaller of the two, with its 6.2-inch 60-120Hz OLED display. Meanwhile, the Pixel 8 Pro is much bigger largely due to its 6.7-inch 1-120Hz pOLED screen. Other key differences include 8GB of RAM on the Pixel 8, versus 12GB on the Pro. There’s also a larger 5,050mAh battery on the Pro, while the Pixel 8 has a 4,575mAh battery. The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro both have some of the best cameras that rival the iPhone 15 series, with the same 50MP main sensor. The Pro adds a 48MP telephoto and 48MP ultrawide lens to the mix, while the Pixel 8 lacks a telephoto lens and has a slightly less impressive 12MP ultrawide. Don’t let that fool you, it’s still a great camera. The front camera remains the same on both as well. In many ways, the Pixel series feels like an Android-based version of the iPhone. Just like the iPhone 15 series, Google is known for its minimalist approach. It’s easy to use and it just works, even if it doesn’t have quite as many bells and whistles as more feature-packed phones like the S24 Ultra. Even better, the Pixel 8 is just $699. The Pixel 7 Pro is $300 more, but that’s still quite affordable for what you get. Google Pixel 7 Google Pixel 7 Tensor G2 processor  •  Upgraded camera  •  Low price MSRP: $599.00 Value for money like no other The Pixel 7 is a flagship Pixel for everyone. It offers the next-gen Google processor, some terrific specs, and a reasonable price. You can upgrade to the Pixel 7 Pro if you want a larger display and even better cameras. See price at Amazon See price at Best Buy See price at AT&T See price at Verizon Google Pixel 7 Pro Google Pixel 7 Pro Best Google camera  •  High-quality display  •  Big battery MSRP: $899.00 The Pixel 7 Pro is the top-of-the-line phone on Google's roster. The Google Pixel 7 Pro takes the best features from the Pixel 6 Pro, and makes them even better. Enjoy numerous camera upgrades and some fun new software tricks, all for the same cost as the last-gen Pixel phone.

The Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 might be worth a look. It’s much more pocketable than Apple’s offerings, for starters. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 looks like your average phone when unfolded, with its sizeable 6.7-inch AMOLED display. When folded in half, it slips right into your pocket. Even better, there’s a 3.4-inch Flex Window screen on the front that still lets you check messages, control music, run full apps, and much more. Under the hood, you’ll get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 2 processor, the latest from Qualcomm. Of course, it’s not all perfect. Battery life is okay at best and there’s no dust protection. It’s more fragile than the iPhone 15 and other conventional phones. Even the camera feels a little like a compromise. There’s just a 12MP wide and 12MP ultrawide camera on the back, with a 10MP front camera. There’s no telephoto or anything. Thankfully, the photo quality is still great, just not quite as good as you’ll get from the iPhone 15 series and some of the others on the list before this. Still, the Galaxy Z Flip is a great phone and is perfect for those who want something that stands out as different from the crowd. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Huge new Flex Window  •  Excellent build quality  •  Solid rear cameras MSRP: $999.99 Samsung's thinnest, most refined clamshell-style foldable yet The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is Samsung's fifth-generation clamshell foldable phone, complete with a 3.4-inch asymmetrical cover display, revamped gapless hinge, and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset. See price at Samsung See price at Amazon Save $0.99 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority Want even more screen real estate than Apple can offer? Look no further than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 . On the outside, it looks like a fairly normal 6.2-inch phone, but unfolding it reveals an interior 7.6-inch tablet-sized display. Just like the Z Flip 5 before it, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor backed by 12GB of RAM. The camera is also excellent, and pretty much the same as you’d find with the non-Ultra members of the S23 series. You get a 50MP primary, a 10MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide sensor. On the flip side, this is an expensive device at around $1,800. It’s also thick, heavy, and has pretty medicare battery life. Just like the Flip, it’s also likely to be a bit more on the fragile side due to its foldable design. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 New hinge finally folds flat  •  Bright, vibrant displays  •  Powerful multitasking features MSRP: $1,799.99 The most powerful folding phone gets even stronger The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 improves on the folding platform with a more reliable hinge, stronger glass, an IPX8 rating, plenty of storage options, and a big, bright display. See price at Samsung See price at Amazon Save $0.99 Sony Xperia 1V and 5V Robert Triggs / Android Authority Sony isn’t as popular as the other companies on this list, but the Sony Xperia 5 V and Xperia 1 V () are still quite capable iPhone 15 alternatives. Unlike Samsung, the only real difference between its two variants is the screen size. The former has a 6.1-inch FHD+ display, while the latter is a 6.5-inch 4K OLED panel. The latest Xperia flagships have the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC found on almost every phone on this list. There’s also the same 5,000mAh battery, which is absolutely massive for a phone the size of the 5 V. Sony also has an excellent camera package, with a 52MP main sensor backed by a 12MP ultrawide and a 12MP telephoto lens. The biggest downside is the price tag. The Xperia 1V can be currently purchased for $1,399, while the more recently announced 5V is expected to start around $1076. That’s a lot to pay for a phone that only has 128GB storage and a software policy that falls behind the rest with just three years of OS updates. See price at Amazon 4 % off Sony Xperia 5 V Compact design Excellent battery life Plenty of multimedia apps See price at Amazon Save $40.06 See price at Manufacturer site Sony Xperia 1 VI 4K display microSD slot Big battery See price at Manufacturer site iPhone 15 alternatives: Honorable mentions Looking for more options? Here are two more worth an honorable mention: Google Pixel 7a ( $477 at Amazon ): While it’s not much cheaper than a Pixel 7, the Pixel 7a is a great phone if you can find it at discount. You’ll get the same Tensor G2 as the main flagships, a great camera, and three years of OS updates with five years of security patches. iPhone SE (2022) ( $429 at Amazon ): The iPhone SE is a great alternative for budget shoppers who want to stick with the iOS platform. Its design might be very small and quite dated, but you still get a powerful A15 chipset and an excellent software update policy that exceeds anything you’ll find in the Android world. Samsung Galaxy S23 series (from $799 at Amazon ): Although it’s no longer Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S23 series is still a stellar trio of smartphones. Not much has changed over the Galaxy S24 line, and expect pricing to be more reasonable with the new line now available. The best Apple Apple iPhone 15 Comments\",\n",

Amy Skorheim Commerce Writer Updated Wed, Sep 13, 2023, 12:56 AM · 3 min read Apple After the usual flurry of rumors , we now know exactly what Apple is packing into the new iPhone 15. We also know models start at $799 and are up for pre-order starting this Friday with availability on September 22. The headline feature is the charging port: now all iPhone 15 models have USB-C instead of the old Lightning port ( thanks, European Union ). Other changes include the introduction of the Dynamic Island, previously reserved for Apple\\'s Pro-level handsets only. Around back, the dual cameras incorporate a 48MP lens and a 12MP telephoto cam with a 2x optical zoom. And now Portrait Mode is enabled automatically, letting you apply the effect later, or not at all. It\\'s all powered by the A16 Bionic chip, previously found in the iPhone 14 Pro models of the previous generation.

Here’s how it works . Phones iPhones iPhone 15 — 6 reasons to buy and 3 reasons to skip Opinion By Philip Michaels published 13 September 2023 Here's a closer look at the iPhone 15's pros and cons Comments (0) (Image credit: Apple) Jump to: Reasons to buy Reasons to skip Outlook The new iPhone 15 figures to divide opinion. For some, it's a phone whose greatest claims to fame revolve around features introduced a year ago. For others, it'll be the chance to enjoy premium features previously limited to Apple's Pro handsets for a couple hundred dollars less. For what's it worth, phones editor John Velasco came away impressed after his iPhone 15 hands-on time, praising the device's upgraded camera and the Dynamic Island feature it picked up from the iPhone 14 Pro . And phone shoppers are sure to be tempted by the $799 starting price — exactly what Apple charged for the more limited iPhone 14 a year ago. But just because a phone offers some appealing feature doesn't mean it's necessarily the right device for you. Here's a closer look at the iPhone 15 features that impressed us and the ones that might have us considering another handset instead. iPhone 15: Reasons to buy A great camera upgrade (Image credit: Future) Yes, the iPhone 15 adopts an improvement that Apple introduced to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max — a 48MP camera sensor that replaces the 12MP main camera that's been an iPhone stable for years. But who cares when an improvement arrives so long as it's there now? With a 48MP main camera, iPhone 15 owners will be able to shot at full resolution for intensely detailed shots. But the iPhone 15 picks up a neat trick from the iPhone 15 Pro when you want to detailed photos at more reasonable file sizes — the sensors bins pixels together for 24MP shots that balance lighting and resolution. We'll have to take the iPhone 15 out into the wild for some marathon shooting sessions to put this new camera to the test, but if it performs anything like the iPhone 14 Pro did, iPhone 15 owners are going to be pleased with the output. 2x optical zoom (Image credit: Apple) Look, Apple may never put a dedicated zoom lens on its standard iPhone — that's just a feature the phone maker's decided should be on Pro handsets only. But at least the iPhone 15 provides a reasonable alternative by tapping both hardware and software to support a 2x zoom capability. Specifically, you're using the main camera to zoom in on subjects by pressing a handy 2x button in the Camera app interface. That gets the 48MP camera to crop in on your subject to produce a sharp 12MP photo without the blur and noise that's sometimes visible in digital zooms. When you shoot video, the zoom is smooth and continuous, too. Improved computational photography (Image credit: Apple) Have you gotten a sense that the cameras on the iPhone 15 may be the new device's marquee feature? That's not just down to the hardware improvements — Apple's also upgraded a lot of imaging software, too, with the end result being better shots, especially when it comes to portraits. You don't even have to be in Portrait mode to take one now — the iPhone's smart enough to detect when people, cats or dogs are in the shot. Software improvements also let you adjust the focal point after the portrait's taken. Night mode sees improvements, too, with Apple promising sharper details and more vivid colors in the images you capture when the lights are down. And the Smart HDR feature has been updated, with improvements to skin tones, highlights and shadows. Naturally, we'll need to test out these promised improvements for ourselves, but given Apple's track record with photo processing, you'd imagine the results will be pretty good. A brighter display (Image credit: Future) We thought the iPhone 14's 6.1-inch screen was all right, but it certainly could have been brighter, considering that both the Galaxy S23 and Pixel 7 outshone it in our testing. Apple clearly doesn't want that to happen again because it's ramping up the peak HDR brightness to 1,600 nits. Meanwhile, peak outdoor brightness on the iPhone 15's screen is now 2,000 nits — double what it was on the iPhone 14. We've only ever seen the iPhone 15 display under the flattering light of Apple's demo area, but we imagine we'll have no trouble making out details on the panel when the sun is out shining. Hello, Dynamic Island. Goodbye, notch (Image credit: Future) We're not sure which excites us more — the arrival of the Dynamic Island cutout that Apple introduced to the iPhone 14 Pro models or the departure of the notch after six long years of obscuring part of the iPhone's screen. We'll say its because the Dynamic Island is here, because that feature stoked some serious envy among iPhone 14 owners. Not only does Dynamic Island house the True Depth and Face ID sensors in a fairly unobtrusive way, it also serves as a home for notifications and live activities. Now it's easy to check baseball scores, monitor timers, check your flight gate and departure time or see when that Uber your ordered might arrive just by glancing at the top of your iPhone's screen. No change in price Despite all these improvements, you'll pay the same for the iPhone 15 as you did for the iPhone 14 — $799 in the U.S., which we'll note is $200 less than the least expensive of Apple's Pro models. With some of the iPhone 15 deals emerging, you might be able to save even more money between now and when the iPhone 15 goes on sale September 22. iPhone 15: Reasons to skip Where's the always-on display? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) If there's an iPhone 14 Pro feature we wish the iPhone 15 could have stolen, it's the always-on display that Apple added a year ago . If you've got one of the iPhone 14 Pro models — and now an iPhone 15 Pro — you can set up your phone's display to show a darkened version of your lock screen when your phone's asleep. That keeps widgets, the time and even your lock screen wallpaper visible without any intervention on your part. I suspect the lack of an always on display feature for the iPhone 15 comes down to the fact that the Pro models have a MotionPro display with a dynamically adjusting refresh rate and devices like the iPhone 15 do not. Still, I wish Apple would have found some way to bring AOD to all of its new iPhones, especially in light of the StandBy Mode feature available in iOS 17 . (Image credit: Tom's Guide) StandBy turns your iPhone into a smart display when you're charging the device and have it propped up horizontally, whether on a charging stand or leaning against some books. This mode displays everything from the time to whatever widgets you want to a slideshow of your favorite photos. StandBy works great on an iPhone with an always-on display — all four of them now that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are joining the iPhone 14 Pro models. But on other phones, there's a frustrating limitation . After a few seconds of inactivity, your iPhone screen goes dark, as your device falls asleep. Only tapping the display keeps StandBy mode going, which kind of defeats the purpose. So essentially, if you buy an iPhone 15, you're not going to see the best of one of iOS 17's top additions. Last year's silicon is back (Image credit: @VNchocoTaco/Twitter) I've already argued that Apple's decision to use different chipsets on different iPhone models in the same phone family is a terrible strategy , and I'm not going to repeat myself here other than to say that I continue to find this a counterproductive way to separate Pro phones from standard models. Look, it's not as if the A16 Bionic inside the iPhone 15 isn't a top performing chipset. We've got the benchmarks from the iPhone 14 Pro to prove it. But the chipset's been out for a year, and the competition is catching up. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2-powered devices already beat out the iPhone 14 Pro on graphics tests like 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited. You'd imagine that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 being announced next month is only going to further close the performance gap with the A16, taking the shine off some of Apple's performance claims about the iPhone 15. No charging speed improvement (Image credit: Future) Apple's move to USB-C is probably the right long-term decision for the company and its iPhones, but some of the main benefits of that switch have yet to materialize. If you want faster data transfer speeds, you need to pay up for an iPhone 15 Pro, as Apple reserves that capability for its pricey phones. And if you want the faster charging you've seen in phones that use USB-C, you'll likely need to wait for the iPhone 16 because there's no improvement here — the iPhone 15 charges at 20W just like a bunch of iPhones before it. iPhone 15 outlook We'll have more to say about the iPhone 15's strengths and weaknesses as we spend more time with this device. Stay tuned for our full review. But right now, the iPhone 15 has a lot of things going for it, particularly around its camera. And that could be enough to overshadow our few complaints about the device.

All of the changes the \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c models are expected to feature compared to their direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have previously covered . We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months. This guide focuses on the iPhone 15 and \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c, but to learn about how we are expecting the iPhone 16 Pro to improve on the iPhone 15 Pro , see our other comparison article . Design The \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c and \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors, meaning that they will have the same dimensions. The most noticeable alteration that will denote the new models is said to be a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture, but the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year\\'s Pro models and the introduction of an all-new \"Capture\" button will also be important changes. \\u200ciPhone 15\\u200c \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c Diagonally arranged rear camera array Vertically arranged rear camera array to support spatial video capture Ring/Silent switch Action Button \"Capture Button\" to trigger photography and videography features iPhone 15 : 171g weight iPhone 15 Plus : 201g weight iPhone 16 : 173g weight (+0.01%) iPhone 16 Plus : 203g weight (+0.01%) Chip, Memory, and Connectivity The \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c models are rumored to benefit from a moderate improvement in processing power thanks to an all-new A18 chip with a more power Neural Engine to support exclusive generative AI capabilities. We are also expecting 33% more memory and Wi-Fi 6E support. \\u200ciPhone 15\\u200c \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c A16 Bionic chip (TSMC\\'s \"N4P\" enhanced 5nm process) A18 chip (TSMC\\'s \"N3E\" enhanced 3nm process) 16-core Neural Engine Neural Engine with \"significantly\" more cores to support new AI features 6GB memory 8GB memory (+33%) Wi-Fi 6 connectivity Wi-Fi 6E connectivity Batteries and Charging The \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c models could receive some major improvements in battery technology and charging, sporting denser batteries and faster charging capabilities. It is worth noting that the \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c Plus is rumored to feature a smaller battery than its predecessor, but it is not clear how this will affect actual battery life. \\u200ciPhone 15\\u200c \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c Single-layer battery technology Stacked battery technology for increased energy density and prolonged lifespan iPhone 15 : 3,349 mAh battery iPhone 15 Plus : 4,383 mAh battery iPhone 16 : 3,561 mAh battery (+6%) iPhone 16 Plus : 4,006 mAh battery (-9%) Up to 27W wired charging Up to 40W wired charging (48% faster) 15W charging via MagSafe 20W charging via \\u200cMagSafe\\u200c (25% faster) Other Features and Changes The \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c models are likely to receive several camera enhancements, such as spatial video capture for the Apple Vision Pro . While many of Apple\\'s devices are rumored to receive a series of new AI-based features via software updates later this year, the \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c models are expected to take these further with exclusive capabilities facilitated by a more powerful Neural Engine in the A18 chip and an upgraded microphone. \\u200ciPhone 15\\u200c \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c More efficient OLED display with brighter micro-lens technology Spatial video capture Upcoming support for new AI features in iOS 18 Upcoming support for new AI features in \\u200ciOS 18\\u200c, plus a suite of device-exclusive AI features Microphone Upgraded microphone with improved signal-to-noise ratio and water resistance, designed to support new AI features Release Date The \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c and \\u200ciPhone 16\\u200c Plus are expected to launch in the fall. Apple usually hosts an event every September to unveil new iPhone models, with launch following just over a week later.

Reviews By Stephen Warwick published 12 January 2024 Comments (0) (Image: © Future) iMore Verdict The iPhone 15 is the best mainstream iPhone in years with USB-C, a 48MP camera, and an awesome new design, but 60Hz remains a disappointing feature.

Verdict Apple’s iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus denote a remarkable return to form for Apple’s mainstream iPhone lineup after a couple of uninspired years in the doldrums. Fresh off a fantastic review of the iPhone 15 Plus , we’re ringing in 2024 with a look at Apple’s latest 6.1-inch iPhone 15. Like its big sibling, the iPhone 15 delivers a series of really enticing upgrades, making it one of the best iPhones in recent years. It boasts all of the same excellent upgrades as the iPhone 15 Plus, including the new 48MP camera, USB-C, a new design, and the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro. So, has Apple finally cracked the winning formula that makes its mainstream, cheaper flagship option a viable upgrade for users? Or will one lacking feature derail the whole operation? Let’s find out. iPhone 15: Price and Availability Released in September 2023, the iPhone 15 is available from Apple.com and all over the world at the usual array of carriers and retailers. The iPhone 15 starts at $799 for the 128GB version. The 256GB model is $899 and the 512GB version is $1099, making it $100 cheaper than each corresponding version of the iPhone 15 Plus. The only difference is storage, and each phone comes boxed with a USB-C to USB-C cable, no charger. You can also get the iPhone 15 at Amazon, Best Buy, Verizon, Target, AT&T, and more. Today\\'s best Apple iPhone 15 deals ₹1,09,900 View We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices iPhone 15: At a glance 48MP camera - the big sensor from the iPhone 14 Pro is here to deliver larger and more detailed photos than ever before. USB-C - the iPhone 15 now charges with a USB-C port and cable Updated design - this update brings a lovely frosted glass upgrade to the rear and rounder edges Brighter display - the iPhone 15 is good for 1000 nits max brightness, 1600 nits peak (HDR), and 2000 nits peak outdoors Dynamic Island - The Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro arrives, replacing the notch iPhone 15: Specs Swipe to scroll horizontally iPhone 15: specs Category iPhone 15 Plus Operating System iOS 17 Display 6.1 inches, 2556 x 1179 (460 ppi) resolution, Super Retina XDR OLED display (iPhone 15) Processor Apple A16 Bionic Storage 128 | 256 | 512GB Rear Camera 48MP, 26mm ƒ/1.6 (wide) | 12MP, ƒ/2.4 (ultra-wide) | 12MP, 52 mmƒ/1.6 (2x Telephoto) Front Camera 12MP, ƒ/1.9, Autofocus Battery Up to 20 hours (video playback) Charging USB-C wired charging, Qi wireless charging up to 15W, MagSafe Water Resistance IP68 Dimensions 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.80mm, 171g Colors Black | Blue | Green | Pink | Yellow iPhone 15: Design (Image credit: Future) The iPhone 15 wows with a stunning new design that is vastly improved over the previous two iterations. As I noted in our iPhone 15 Plus review, the previous “regular” has had a really underwhelming design for a couple of years. The edges were much too sharp, and its awful glossy back was a fingerprint magnet. This year, Apple has transformed the iPhone 15 with a new “color-infused” glass back that offers you a delightful frosted finish. It’s soft to the touch, easy to grip, and shows absolutely none of the marks or blemishes that the old one used to. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this change alone should be enough to convince iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 users to make the leap to 2024’s best offering. The design changes don’t stop there, either. The edges of the iPhone 15 are decidedly more rounded and much softer than in previous years, and the camera bump is now transparent. All in all, Apple has transformed the iPhone 15 with its design this year. Other aspects remain familiar, however. There are still two volume buttons, a Lock Button, and the Mute Switch. No Action button here, you’ll need to go Pro if you want the customizable alternative that lets you choose several different actions beyond simple mute. Otherwise, the iPhone 15 sports its familiar aluminum chassis and the hardy Ceramic Shield on the front. This glass panel is designed to be tougher to shatter while being more prone to scratches as a compromise. However, after several weeks of use, I’ve yet to notice any of the scratches that plagued my iPhone 14 experience last year, so this is another big improvement. (Image credit: Future) Other design specs include IP68 water resistance, which means you can submerge it in up to 6 meters of water for 30 minutes. Weight and dimensions are also broadly the same as in previous years, and Apple has made some tweaks under the hood to make some repairs cheaper and easier. The only big letdown in the design department is the color. There are five: black, blue, green, yellow, and pink. I’ve now been hands-on with both blue and green, but honestly, both might as well be grey/off-white. The hue around the frame is more noticeable, but the rear is so muted it might as well not be any color at all. Pink, yellow, and black remain the more vibrant color options. iPhone 15: Display (Image credit: Future) Apple has not really changed the display in the iPhone 15 this year, so if you have an iPhone 13 or iPhone 14, you’re not going to notice a difference in day-to-day use. It’s the same Super Retina XDR display measuring 6.1-inch, and offering a resolution of 2556x1179-pixel resolution at 460 ppi. It offers all the usual HDR, True Tone, and Wide Color (PR) support, but the big news this year is brightness. The typical max brightness has been uprated to 1,000 nits, and the outdoor brightness peak is now 2,000 nits. This means your iPhone’s display is going to be much easier to see in direct sunlight or well-lit areas, and this rings true. You can still, of course, control the brightness in your iOS settings, but cranked all the way up, it is noticeably brighter than previous models. While resolution and color quality haven’t changed, the biggest visual improvement in iPhone 15 is the Dynamic Island, which replaces the outgoing notch, now completely eschewed from the iPhone line. I’ve used the Dynamic Island for over a year on my iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 Pro models, and on the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 more recently. There’s no doubt that it’s a genius piece of technology that really transforms the iPhone experience. Adding animated functionality to the Dynamic Island means you forget the pill-shaped whole is even there while using it. We’re still not seeing a ton of third-party Dynamic Island apps, but Apple has done enough to make it useful. Even seeing your calls and timers on the island is enough to make me giddy sometimes. (Image credit: Future) So those are the improvements, but there is one significant drawback to the iPhone 15’s display. It still features a 60Hz refresh rate. If you’ve never used an iPhone, iPad, or Mac with a 120Hz ProMotion display, this isn’t an issue, and you won’t notice the difference. If you have, however, the 60Hz iPhone 15 will feel like a PowerPoint presentation by comparison. Using most apps and playing games, you won’t really notice the 60Hz refresh rate, but I find it to be most irksome using menus and unlocking the phone. While I understand that 120Hz remains reserved for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro range, I don’t see why we can’t get a beefier 90Hz without Always-On or variable refresh rate, just to make the iPhone 15 a bit smoother in day-to-day use. It’s a big letdown in what’s otherwise a very impressive package. iPhone 15: Performance (Image credit: Future) Just like the iPhone 15 Plus, the iPhone 15 excels in performance thanks to its blazing-fast A16 Bionic chip. Adopted from the iPhone 14 Pro, it can run any app or game that you throw at it with ease. Specifically, it features two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores, and a 5-core GPU with 50 percent more bandwidth than the iPhone 14. This means you can enjoy every game on the App Store with no hiccups, lag, or framerate drops. It’s also very important for the powerful new camera we’ll be talking about soon. With a 16-core neural engine, computational photography is more powerful than ever on the regular iPhone. With slightly better thermals, the iPhone 15 Plus will benchmark slightly ahead of the iPhone 15, but this means very little when it comes to real-world performance. Essentially, there is nothing the iPhone 15 can’t do, and you’re going to be set for several years of iOS software updates, futureproofing your device if you’re not a serial upgrader. Just like the iPhone 15 Plus, the iPhone 15’s A16 Bionic Chip actually betrays that 60Hz refresh rate and amplifies how annoying it is, it’s clear the screen can’t keep up with the phone at certain times, leading to a shaky experience in menus and on the Home Screen. Slight Wi-Fi improvements seen in the iPhone 15 Plus continue here, too, but it’s the iPhone 15 Pro that gets Wi-Fi 6E for a significant boost. The biggest connectivity boost is a new second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that powers close-range interactions. This is used for finding things like AirPods and AirTags, but can also be used with an Apple Watch Series 9 or Ultra 2 to locate your iPhone with Precision Finding. This also works between iPhone 15 models and can be used to locate lost friends or relatives in crowds at festivals, concerts, and beyond. iPhone 15: Camera (Image credit: Future) The iPhone 15’s headline upgrade is a new 48MP main camera that spits out 24MP super-high-resolution images by default. The main camera features a quad-pixel sensor and 100 percent Focus Pixels and also offers 2x Telephoto shooting to give the illusion of three optical levels of zoom alongside 0.5x and 1x. If you like portrait photography, the iPhone 15 is the best mainstream iPhone yet, with better details, colors, and low-light performance. The fanciest new feature is a mode that can turn any photo of a person, dog, or cat into a portrait photo even if you didn’t shoot it in portrait mode. Night mode also gets a boost alongside the introduction of Smart HDR 5. This is the best camera ever put in a regular iPhone, so here are some of the shots we were able to take with the iPhone 15’s camera. Here are some of our shots in the \"out of the box\" mode: 24 MP 26mm f.16. This is the default setting on the iPhone 15, and I remain very impressed with the 24MP format. Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) The new portrait mode also wows with crispy edges and excellent detail: Image 1 of 1 (Image credit: Future) Finally, the 48MP camera shoots massive photos with expansive range and great detail: Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) iPhone 15: Battery, charging, and USB-C (Image credit: Future) With a 3,349 mAh battery, Apple says the iPhone 15 is good for 20 hours of video playback or 16 hours of video streaming. As always, the iPhone 15 Plus is the battery life king, boasting the largest battery and fewer power-hungry features. According to our friends at Tom’s Guide, the iPhone 15 scores 11 hours and five minutes in their bog-standard battery life test. By contrast, the iPhone 15 Plus scores 14 hours and 14 minutes, and the iPhone 14 scores nine hours and 28 minutes. As you can see, the latter shows the iPhone 15’s battery has markedly improved from last year’s iPhone 14 model, and an aging battery is always a great excuse to buy a new phone. The iPhone 15 range also seems less susceptible to the quite high battery wear that impacted the iPhone 14 range. Another headline upgrade this year is USB-C, and having gotten over the initial shock of finding all my Lightning cables were now useless, I’m enjoying having USB-C around the house a bit more than I used to. I continue to charge my iPhones exclusively on a MagSafe charging stand in iOS 17’s StandBy mode, but when you do need some juice, it’s nice to know that whatever USB-C cable you have lying around will fit your iPhone. My main gripe from the iPhone 15 Plus review stands, however. Eliminating Lightning has reduced, rather than increased, the number of ways I can charge my iPhone. As per our friend Neil Cybart on Twitter, USB-C cables are used for Macs, iPads, and every other device in the house. The Lightning cable was always reserved for the iPhone, and as such always available. This novelty has now gone, but now I’m more used to it, plugging in my iPhone and iPad to the same wall outlet is a more convenient experience. USB-C doesn’t bring any upgrades to file or data transfers, however. It’s still USB-C 2 just like the iPhone 14. If you want USB 3 speeds you’ll want Apple’s best iPhone, the iPhone 15 Pro. This is a tad annoying given the iPhone 15 shoots 48MP photos, but in reality, when was the last time you plugged your iPhone into a computer to do any type of data transfer? iPhone 15: iOS 17 (Image credit: Future) The iPhone 15 ships with iOS 17 out of the box, and will continue to do so until iOS 18 drops later this year. This time around, Apple has updated the Phone app, Messages, and FaceTime. Some big new features include Contact Posters, StandBy, and interactive widgets. I love the latter as it lets you interact with apps directly from your iPhone’s Home Screen, so you can do things like turn off a HomeKit light without opening the Home app. I noted in our iPhone 15 Plus review that Autocorrect seems to have taken a step back this year, and I remain convinced of this five months on. Like Mac and iPad, iPhone excels in part because of the harmony between hardware and software, and because of the synergy with Apple’s wider ecosystem. You’ll benefit most from the iPhone 15 and iOS 17 if you also use an iPad, Mac, AirPods, AirTags, or even an Apple TV. Since its initial launch Apple has added some cool new features to iOS 17 including a new feature that makes it harder for thieves to access your iPhone using your passcode. It’s also possible Apple could be planning to add third-party app stores and sideloading before WWDC 2024. iPhone 15: The competition: iPhone 14 Pro and beyond (Image credit: Future) It may be a cliche, but if you’re considering the iPhone 15 then it’s likely that the main competition for your vote is other iPhones. The main Android-powered rivals to the iPhone 15 are the Google Pixel 8, and the larger Pixel 8 Pro, and the Samsung Galaxy S23 range. If you want a larger iPhone without the bells and whistles of the Pro, I’d recommend the iPhone 15 Plus as a valiant competitor. It has a much better battery life and a much larger screen, and this year’s design changes make its larger chassis much easier on the hands. If you do want bells and whistles then the iPhone 15 Pro is the one for you. However, as I noted in my iPhone 15 Plus review, the most viable alternative to the iPhone 15 is the iPhone 14 Pro. It has the same chip, 48MP camera, Dynamic Island, but offers an extra lens for photography and most importantly, a 120Hz ProMotion display. Should you buy the iPhone 15? Buy the iPhone 15 if... You are upgrading from the iPhone 13 or 14 This is a marked improvement on both predecessors and worth your money to make the switch You don’t want the size of the iPhone 15 Plus The iPhone 15 is a nice compromise if the iPhone 15 Plus is just too big You want USB-C and the Dynamic Island If you’ve held off upgrading your iPhone for USB-C and the Dynamic Island, this is the model for you Don\\'t buy the iPhone 15 if... You want Apple’s best iPhone The best iPhone Apple offers is the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, with a better processor, better cameras, and a battery display You want a 120Hz ProMotion display If that refresh rate is important to you, buy a “Pro” iPhone from the last two years You want the best camera in an iPhone The iPhone 15 Pro Max offers the best iPhone camera going thanks to its 5x Zoom, Apple ProRAW, Macro mode, and other features. iPhone 15: Verdict (Image credit: Future) The iPhone 15 is a triumphant upgrade over the iPhone 14 and a massive, much-needed improvement for the regular iPhone lineup. Upgrades will love USB-C, the Dynamic Island, and taking 48MP photos. However, if you want the very best Apple has to offer, the iPhone 15 Pro offers a more feature-rich experience with a better refresh rate and better cameras. iPhone 15 Plus ₹449 at Amazon ₹80,490 at Amazon ₹80,490 at Amazon Bottom line: Apple\\'s iPhone 15 is a massive upgrade on the iPhone 14 with a brilliant new camera, USB-C, and a design to die for.

Mobile iPhone and iPad The best iPhone 15 alternatives: 6 phones to consider before you buy The iPhone 15 looks great, but it's not for everyone. By Andrew Grush • January 17, 2024 Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority Apple recently unveiled its latest flagship series, the iPhone 15 family. The latest iPhones bring quite a few features and a welcome move to USB-C. There’s a lot to love about them, but what if you aren’t sold on iOS or want something different? That’s what we are here for. Join us as we take a look at the best iPhone 15 alternatives on the market today. Apple iPhone 14 series Robert Triggs / Android Authority If you’re looking for the best alternative to the iPhone 15 series, you might just want to stick with the iPhone 14 family . Sure, you’ll be dealing with slightly older hardware, but you’ll also save a good amount of cash. You’ll also get the same software eventually now that the iOS 17 update has rolled out. The iPhone 14 family varies a bit depending on what model you get. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have the most in common, as both use the same Apple A16 Bionic SoC and storage variants ranging from 128GB to 512GB. There are also the same 12MP wide and ultrawide cameras. Battery life is better on the Plus thanks to its larger size, and of course, the Plus has a larger 6.7-inch screen compared to the iPhone 14. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max jump up to an Apple A16 processor and have storage configurations as high as 1TB. They also have the same 48MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 12MP telephoto lenses. Even if they are a year old, the iPhone 14 series holds up extremely well against the iPhone 15 and 2023 Android flagships. Just be aware you won’t get Apple’s Apple A17 on the Pro series or the A16 on the iPhone 14 and Plus. You’ll also be stuck with a Lightning port over USB-C . Apple iPhone 14 Apple iPhone 14 All-day battery life  •  Capable cameras  •  Great software support MSRP: $799.00 The cheapest phone of the series While the iPhone 14 isn't a massive upgrade over its predecessor, it's still a great phone overall. It has a great design, long-term software support, and a capable camera system. It also costs a lot less than the other phones in the series.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 series fits the bill, with a comprehensive list of hardware and software features. The three models in the range share base specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, 120Hz AMOLED displays, an IP68 rating, and similar tertiary cameras. As with the iPhone 15 series, the models have a few differences. The Galaxy S24 is the smallest option, with a 6.2-inch display and a 4,000mAh battery. Just above it on the pecking order is the Galaxy S24 Plus, packing a larger 6.7-inch display and a 4,900mAh battery. For those who crave everything and the kitchen sink, the Galaxy S24 Ultra brings a titanium frame, an S Pen , a 200MP primary camera, two telephoto lenses with optically reach up to 5x, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The biggest selling point for most will be Samsung’s new software commitments. All three devices will receive updates for seven years, extending their working lives well into the 2030s. Samsung is also pushing its AI smarts with tools that enrich the phones’ productivity and imaging powers. While the two base models retain their predecessors’ sticker prices, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a little pricier this year. Samsung Galaxy S24 Samsung Galaxy S24 Slimmer than ever  •  Victus 2 glass  •  Bright display MSRP: $799.99 Powerful AI smarts and slimmer bezels The Samsung Galaxy S24 series focuses on added AI technology. With a 6.2-inch, 120Hz display, 128GB or 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and up to 2,600 nits peak display brightness, the S24 is promising to be a quality update in the line. The new AI features go deep, improving your experience with the camera, search, and much more.

While its specs might not be quite as powerful as some of the others on this list, it has one of the best smartphone camera experiences you’ll find. It’s also a bit more affordable, which is a nice bonus. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are both powered by the same Tensor G3 chipset, which adds plenty of machine learning and AI capabilities that help it shine. It’s also much better at heat dissipation, something that was a serious issue for the Pixel 7 family. The Pixel 8 is the smaller of the two, with its 6.2-inch 60-120Hz OLED display. Meanwhile, the Pixel 8 Pro is much bigger largely due to its 6.7-inch 1-120Hz pOLED screen. Other key differences include 8GB of RAM on the Pixel 8, versus 12GB on the Pro. There’s also a larger 5,050mAh battery on the Pro, while the Pixel 8 has a 4,575mAh battery. The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro both have some of the best cameras that rival the iPhone 15 series, with the same 50MP main sensor. The Pro adds a 48MP telephoto and 48MP ultrawide lens to the mix, while the Pixel 8 lacks a telephoto lens and has a slightly less impressive 12MP ultrawide. Don’t let that fool you, it’s still a great camera. The front camera remains the same on both as well. In many ways, the Pixel series feels like an Android-based version of the iPhone. Just like the iPhone 15 series, Google is known for its minimalist approach. It’s easy to use and it just works, even if it doesn’t have quite as many bells and whistles as more feature-packed phones like the S24 Ultra. Even better, the Pixel 8 is just $699. The Pixel 7 Pro is $300 more, but that’s still quite affordable for what you get. Google Pixel 7 Google Pixel 7 Tensor G2 processor  •  Upgraded camera  •  Low price MSRP: $599.00 Value for money like no other The Pixel 7 is a flagship Pixel for everyone.

The Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 might be worth a look. It’s much more pocketable than Apple’s offerings, for starters. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 looks like your average phone when unfolded, with its sizeable 6.7-inch AMOLED display. When folded in half, it slips right into your pocket. Even better, there’s a 3.4-inch Flex Window screen on the front that still lets you check messages, control music, run full apps, and much more. Under the hood, you’ll get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 2 processor, the latest from Qualcomm. Of course, it’s not all perfect. Battery life is okay at best and there’s no dust protection. It’s more fragile than the iPhone 15 and other conventional phones. Even the camera feels a little like a compromise. There’s just a 12MP wide and 12MP ultrawide camera on the back, with a 10MP front camera. There’s no telephoto or anything. Thankfully, the photo quality is still great, just not quite as good as you’ll get from the iPhone 15 series and some of the others on the list before this. Still, the Galaxy Z Flip is a great phone and is perfect for those who want something that stands out as different from the crowd. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Huge new Flex Window  •  Excellent build quality  •  Solid rear cameras MSRP: $999.99 Samsung's thinnest, most refined clamshell-style foldable yet The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is Samsung's fifth-generation clamshell foldable phone, complete with a 3.4-inch asymmetrical cover display, revamped gapless hinge, and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset. See price at Samsung See price at Amazon Save $0.99 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority Want even more screen real estate than Apple can offer? Look no further than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 . On the outside, it looks like a fairly normal 6.2-inch phone, but unfolding it reveals an interior 7.6-inch tablet-sized display. Just like the Z Flip 5 before it, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor backed by 12GB of RAM. The camera is also excellent, and pretty much the same as you’d find with the non-Ultra members of the S23 series. You get a 50MP primary, a 10MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide sensor. On the flip side, this is an expensive device at around $1,800. It’s also thick, heavy, and has pretty medicare battery life. Just like the Flip, it’s also likely to be a bit more on the fragile side due to its foldable design. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 New hinge finally folds flat  •  Bright, vibrant displays  •  Powerful multitasking features MSRP: $1,799.99 The most powerful folding phone gets even stronger The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 improves on the folding platform with a more reliable hinge, stronger glass, an IPX8 rating, plenty of storage options, and a big, bright display.

Unlike Samsung, the only real difference between its two variants is the screen size. The former has a 6.1-inch FHD+ display, while the latter is a 6.5-inch 4K OLED panel. The latest Xperia flagships have the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC found on almost every phone on this list. There’s also the same 5,000mAh battery, which is absolutely massive for a phone the size of the 5 V. Sony also has an excellent camera package, with a 52MP main sensor backed by a 12MP ultrawide and a 12MP telephoto lens. The biggest downside is the price tag. The Xperia 1V can be currently purchased for $1,399, while the more recently announced 5V is expected to start around $1076. That’s a lot to pay for a phone that only has 128GB storage and a software policy that falls behind the rest with just three years of OS updates.

Here are two more worth an honorable mention: Google Pixel 7a ( $477 at Amazon ): While it’s not much cheaper than a Pixel 7, the Pixel 7a is a great phone if you can find it at discount. You’ll get the same Tensor G2 as the main flagships, a great camera, and three years of OS updates with five years of security patches. iPhone SE (2022) ( $429 at Amazon ): The iPhone SE is a great alternative for budget shoppers who want to stick with the iOS platform. Its design might be very small and quite dated, but you still get a powerful A15 chipset and an excellent software update policy that exceeds anything you’ll find in the Android world. Samsung Galaxy S23 series (from $799 at Amazon ): Although it’s no longer Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S23 series is still a stellar trio of smartphones. Not much has changed over the Galaxy S24 line, and expect pricing to be more reasonable with the new line now available. The best Apple Apple iPhone 15 Comments\""
